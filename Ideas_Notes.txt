The core idea is to create a bingo game with rocket league based squares.
Use elden ring bingo as referance/example

- There should be a GUI which allows user to input bingo square entries, select mode and start the game
- May have to have rooms/passcode so people can edit the same board
- Upon starting the game, the bingo board should stay on screen at all times
- The bingo card should be interactive with mouse
- The bingo card should/can be shared with mutliple users for lockout game type
